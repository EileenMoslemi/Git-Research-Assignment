1. Fork

A fork is a copy of someone else’s GitHub repository that is created under your own GitHub account.
Forking allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project. It is commonly used in open-source projects so contributors can propose improvements safely.

Why it’s useful:

You don’t need permission to edit the original repo

You can make changes independently

You can later suggest your changes using a pull request
