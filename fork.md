# Fork

A **fork** is a copy of someone else’s GitHub repository that is created under your own GitHub account.
Forking allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.

Forks are commonly used in open-source projects so contributors can make changes independently and
later suggest improvements.

## Why Fork Is Useful
- You can modify code without permission
- Your changes do not affect the original repository
- You can contribute to projects safely
