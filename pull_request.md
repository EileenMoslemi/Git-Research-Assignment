# Pull Request

A **pull request (PR)** is a GitHub feature used to ask that your changes be reviewed and merged into

Pull requests are mainly used when working with teams or contributing to open-source projects.

## Typical Pull Request Workflow
1. Fork a repository
2. Make changes in your fork
3. Open a pull request
