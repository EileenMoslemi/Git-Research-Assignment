# Bonus Task – Clone, Commit, and Push

## Step 1: Clone the Repository

I cloned my GitHub repository to my local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/Git-Research-Assignment.git
```

This command created a local copy of the repository on my computer.

## Step 2: Create a New File
After cloning, I navigated into the repository folder and created a new file called bonus.md.

## Step 3: Commit the Changes
I added the new file and committed it using these commands:

```bash
git add bonus.md
git commit -m "Add bonus task documentation"
```

## Step 4: Push to GitHub
Finally, I pushed the commit back to GitHub with:

```bash
git push origin main
```
This uploaded the new file to the remote repository successfully.
